Not a lot to talk about this week.

## Tools Show and Share

Working on a show-and-share featuring the following:

- [Zed Editor](https://zed.dev/): Fast editor written in rust. 
- [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat): Command line LLM client. Good for working through tricky bash and git options.

## Challenges of the Week

- Adapting a legacy web component to read a new data spec as part of our plaid integration. So far it's mostly understanding the old data structure and renaming fields so that everything (hopefully) works. 
- Translation tags for a feature I've been working on.

## Games 

- Started a playthrough of [The Alters](https://altersthegame.com/). This is similar to the 1996 movie [Multiplicity](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117108/) where a stressed-out husband clones himself multiple times. *The Alters* is a base-building survival game centered around Jan, a construction expert. Fortunately, he has weird science to clone himself multiple times, giving each clone fake memories. Unfortunately, each clone has survived a different set of challenges and traumas. As is frequently the case in survival scifi, your biggest challenge is yourself.
- Backed [Defy the Gods](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hecticelectron/defy-the-gods-rpg), a mesopotamian-themed TTRPG.
- Picked up [Homeworld: Revelations](https://modiphius.net/en-us/pages/homeworld), because I've never been quite able to get the CRPG to run.
