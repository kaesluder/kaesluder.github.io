Most of this week has been applying bugfixes, interface refining, and unit test
techniques discussed earlier.

## Neurodivergence

  no significant rise in the prevalence of ADHD, but research is flawed.

## Digital Music

Digital music has been an on-and-off interest. Spent part of this week playing
with [Bespoke](https://www.bespokesynth.com/) a cross-platform modular software
synth.

Example:

Modular synthesis breaks the process of sound creation into separate modules. A
bare-bones circuit or "patch" includes:

1. An instrument, sequencer, or controller that creates pitch data.
2. An oscillator that creates noise.
3. An envelope module that determines the volume of each note over time.
4. An amplifier that determines the overall volume for multiple notes.
5. Optional filters and affect to change the quality of the sound.
6. An output device (typically speakers).

Modular synthesis gets interesting when you chain the output of one module to
the control to another. This can create interesting feedback loops and
unpredictable behavior.
