# Home

Iâ€™m a fullstack developer with 12 years of professional edTech experience. I graduated from Ada Developers Academy and interned with Amazon AuthX in 2023. This is a space to [_Learn in Public_ (PDF)](https://learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf) by sharing snippets, resources, and howtos on current projects. Much of this is inspired by how many techniques end up passed through video or confined behind a login wall.

Current interests include:

- Rust: Leveling up skills with tauri and command-line apps.
- Obsidian: Knowledge management and document organization for learning and table-top RPG play.
- Prompt Engineering: Using large language models for reflection and documentation.

## Projects

- [Radio Gaga](https://github.com/kaesluder/radiogaga): Streaming radio browser built on tauri and svelte.
- [Drama Llama](https://github.com/kaesluder/drama-llama-py): Experimental RSS feed reader built on flask and react.
- [Euler Project Problems](https://github.com/kaesluder/euler-problems): Most of these were from 5-10 years ago when I was experimenting in functional-first languages.
